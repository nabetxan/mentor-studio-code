# Change Log

All notable changes to "Mentor Studio Code" will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Uninstall Guide in Settings — selective cleanup (`.mentor` folder, profile data, CLAUDE.md reference) with confirmation dialog before destructive actions, followed by optional one-click extension uninstall
- Safety check during Setup — detect pre-existing `.mentor` folder not created by this extension and warn before overwriting (irreversible)

### Changed

- Clarify that this extension is an independent project optimized for use with Claude Code, not affiliated with Anthropic — updated README, landing page, and app-specification
- Remove hardcoded subscription plan names (Claude Pro / Max); link to Anthropic's official documentation for current requirements and plans
- Add disclaimer and trademark attribution to README, landing page, and app-specification
- Replace "Remove Mentor" button with the new Uninstall Guide flow

### Fixed

- Clear `learnerProfile` from `globalState` when cleanup is executed with profile option selected
- Read locale from `.mentor/config.json` instead of relying solely on system locale for Remove Mentor / Cleanup dialogs
- Add safety check with `parseConfig` before modifying `config.json` to avoid corrupting invalid JSON

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Learner profile global sync — `learner_profile` is now stored in VSCode's `globalState` and synced bidirectionally with each project's `progress.json` using `last_updated` timestamps (newer wins), so profile data persists across workspaces
- Merge Topics section in Overview tab — merge any topic into another (including new topics) independent of review status
- Delete Topics section in Overview tab with multi-select checkbox dropdown (topics with related data are disabled; hint guides user to merge first)
- Remove Mentor command to uninstall mentor configuration from a project
- Uninstall hook to disable mentor (`enableMentor: false`, `extensionUninstalled: true`) in `.mentor/config.json` when extension is uninstalled
- CLAUDE.md management service for adding/removing mentor rule references
- Settings UI with Remove Mentor button in sidebar
- Profile last updated date display in Settings tab

### Fixed

- Workspace handling in setup command and sidebar provider
- Hide sidebar icon in empty windows (no folder open) to prevent blank webview

### Changed

- Update GitHub Actions to latest versions (checkout@v5, configure-pages@v5, upload-pages-artifact@v4, deploy-pages@v5)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

- Pre-release
